      In the last instant under the fire avalanche, other choruses, oblivious,
      could be heard announcing the time, cutting the lawn by remote-control
      mower, or setting an umbrella frantically out and in, the slamming and
      opening front door, a thousand things happening, like a clock shop when
      each clock strikes the hour insanely before or after the other, a scene of
      maniac confusion, yet unity; singing, screaming, a few last cleaning mice
      darting bravely out to carry the horrid ashes away! And one voice, with
      sublime disregard for the situation, read poetry aloud in the fiery study,
      until all the film spools burned, until all the wires withered and the
      circuits cracked. The fire burst the house and let it slam flat down,
      puffing out skirts ofspark and smoke. In the kitchen, an instant before
      the rain of fire and timber, the stove could be seen making breakfasts at
      a psychopathic rate, ten dozen eggs, six loaves of toast, twenty dozen
      bacon strips, which, eaten by fire, started the stove working again,
      hysterically hissing! The crash. The attic smashing into kitchen and
      parlour. The parlour into cellar, cellar into sub-cellar. Deep freeze,
      armchair, film tapes, circuits, beds, and all like skeletons thrown in a
      cluttered mound deep under. Smoke and silence. A great quantity ofsmoke.
      Dawn showed faintly in the east. Among the ruins, one wallstood alone.
      Within the wall, a last voice said, over and over again and again, even as
      the sun rose to shine upon the heaped rubble and steam: "Today is August
      5, 2026, today is August 5, 2026, today is..."
